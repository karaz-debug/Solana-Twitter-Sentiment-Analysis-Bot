# Solana Twitter Sentiment Analysis Bot

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Solana Twitter Sentiment Analysis Bot** is an automated system designed to collect, filter, and analyze real-time tweets related to Solana (SOL). Utilizing Python and libraries such as `twkit`, `httpx`, and `nltk`, this bot aims to provide valuable insights into market sentiment by processing and categorizing tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This project is currently in development, with ongoing enhancements to improve functionality and accuracy.
